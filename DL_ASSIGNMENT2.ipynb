I’ll try to watch it when I’m wide away maybe take  a vitamin shot lol I’ll give it a try!\n",

But at some point after 1:30 hour of non stop dialogues, non of that matter, everyone I know was watching their clocks to see how much more of the same think will watch, the movie became a podcast, and the acting was great but you see the same faces taking the same expressions for 3 hours you become tolerant to that too\n",

I would just tone down the editing in some places, like when he announces the drop to the audience and the sound editing is a bit overdone, also when he hallucinates stepping on the carbonised body of a victim, I think that was too much and not needed.

Nothing makes me happier than a well made, well written film that just envelopes me and immerses me. Not for a moment did I check out. cillians performance was so intense and so lived in that I believed it more than I thought I would. Peaky blinders was my favorite work from him but goddamn he really is something special he does his job very very well not for a second did I see a hint of anyone else but Oppenheimer. And MY GOD the visuals were just incredible everything felt like it had texture like it was an old film ripped from a 50s movie but then it could also be so crisp and clean and it didn’t feel out of place. The visual effects and showing everything that’s going on in other characters mind were fantastic! The movie gave me a knot in my stomach- excited-dreading feeling the whole time. It moved really fast and sometimes I didn’t quite get everything that was going on until the end and that’s really my only problem with the movie. The detonation scene deserves and Oscar win all on its own it was so terrifying and beautiful and the way Nolan presented it couldn’t have been done better. Anyways rant is over thanks for talking about this one Chris! I’m really excited for your movie too!\n",

            "Comment 40: Mediocre movie at best. Zero effort to show characters actions, just fast dialogue. We don't know why and what Oppenheimer did to be genius. There is no physics explanation. The first 80 min is just a mess of dialogue with zero coherence. We see very little fire in the movie. The poster is full of fire. We see ZERO consequences of the atomic bomb. Nolan's worst film for sure. A film is a visual and audio medium. I did not came to an Imax theater to read dialogue. On the positive side, the movie has two excellent performances. Just watch it in Bluray, no need to go to the cinema.\n",

            "Comment 47: Easily one of the most tediously boring films I've ever seen. If you enjoy watching 3 hours worth of Senate testimony you might like this film. And the big moment looks nothing like an atomic bomb. Imax does nothing for this film.  It's as equally boring in either format. Chris Nolan does not deserve the accolades he gets.  He is no Auteur.  This is a confusing boring film.  I was not impressed in the least. Sure the acting is good but the sequences go nowhere.  Once the bomb goes off the film grinds into the ground.  And theres an hour of it. I couldn't wait for it to end\n",

I won't spoil anything but know exactly what Chris is talking about regarding his favorite scene with Emily Blunt. Felt privileged to see in the theater... ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Sad to see the state of things right now in the movie industry and truly hope somehow that all the incredibly talented people who come together to make films like this never go away...🙏👍✊❤\n",

My dad is going deaf & can't hear anything about about 7khz so he struggles a lot with stuff that isn't litterally loud & clear. I'm small time but I'm a sound egnieer myself & I had the same gripes with the mix. I know it was done that way on purpose for whatever reason but I do wish I could have understood more of what was being said. I sadly did not have the chance to see it in imax & the only truly loud part was \"the\" bang, at least in the theatre I saw it in.

            "Comment 73: _Oppenheimer_ was NOT good.  It was 3 hrs and about 1.5 hrs too long. Way too much political and judicial inquiry type stuff. Pretty much half the movie was board meetings at which people were being grilled. There was not enough nuclear science and intellectually and visually stimulating events taking place.  There were some of course, but not enough to justify the 3 hour run-time.  It seems Hollywood is either making brainless action movies with nothing but action and CGI and special effects, or tiresome historical films like Oppenheimer.   There should be a healthy middle ground.\n",

            "Comment 79: The film was very loud in some parts which made it impactful but people with sensitivity to sound might want to wear earplugs. This film was very good and so important to show to a wide audience. As someone who has family that lived through the bombings in Japan, I think I was important to see the history behind the attacks. It stirred me emotionally in a way I didn’t expect and I’m glad I had that experience. It was definitely heavy though.\n",
            "Comment 80: The score was underwhelming at best. Unimaginative and uninspired. The violins worked so well in the build-up to trinity because of the silence that was used as a means of style, to drive home this monumentale point in history. Most of the score is bland, boring and hardly good music. The rest of tge film - perfection. I wish the conversation with Einstein was real.\n",
            "Comment 81: If you want a philosophical, thought provoking, edge of your seat drama that's riveting from beginning till the end, about the moral implications surrounding nuclear power and the splitting of the atom, and the ensuing horrors that result from such a Promethean discovery, then skip Oppenheimer and re watch HBOs Chernobyl, because Oppenheimer was 3 hours of discussing his loyalty to the US government and whether or not he was a communist, skipping from one stale interview room to another. \n",

            "Let me preempt your snarky response, no, you are not intellectually superior to me, no, I don't lack an attention span and no, I dont like Marvel super hero movies. Finally, yes the movie is called Oppenheimer so its a biopic about his life (yes I know what a biopic is) but what is so special about his life? What is it history remembers him for,  and why is there a movie being made about him to begin with? It's because he's the father of the Atom Bomb. The movie should of been about the Manhatten project, the race with the Nazis, and the implications of nuclear war, how all of human civilisation can now be ended in a microsecond thanks to this awful discovery. That's what the movie should of been centered around IMO as its the most important element of his life.\n",
            "Comment 82: I'm still amazed by how little people talk about the way managed humor in this movie. I have a bunch of laugh there. Humor wasn't handled as jokes but winks about current topics that are still happening, like the discussion on the probabilistic approach of quantum physics versus the non- probabilistic take on relativity. Another example happened with the treatment given to Feynman, or the mix of dialogue versus what was written on the blackboard. I couldn't laugh more on those scenes.\n",
            "Comment 83: I've seen Oppenheimer twice and, generally, I struggle massively with films due to my attention span, but it is one of the very few films that has me completely hooked. I'm a history geek and so I absolutely loved it. The cast was incredible and Nolan's directing was some of the best I've seen. I can't wait to see it again.\n",

She's married only 1x (Travis), and doesnt need to flaunt herself all over magazines, going to elite ceremonies, award shows and so on. She's never altered her image or had to do anything to say \"LOOK AT ME, EVERYONE!!\" To bring up drama, especially saying things about your kids, esp while pregnant, is just horrible. The fact that Kim could sit there and spew such garbage when her own life is far worse than anyone elses, her own kids father is getting kicked out of other countries for committing s3x acts which we ALL know why and HOW Kim got her first start on TV!..i mean, c'mon already!\n",
